Hi ðŸ‘‹! Here is **Meirui Jiang**, second year Ph.D. student in the [CSE](http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/), [CUHK](http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/). 

My research interest lies in computer vision and machine learning with applications for medical image analysis. I aim to promote the applicability (regarding explainability, privacy and generalizability) of AI research for healthcare. Recently I focus on federated learning.

Please learn more about me from my [personal website](https://meiruijiang.github.io/MeiruiJiang/).
